**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a single-page React application using Three.js and GSAP to create an animated 3D space scene. The backend is a minimal FastAPI server with a single endpoint for a contact form. The frontend displays all the user-requested content sections overlaid on the 3D background. The agent has iterated multiple times on the 3D scene, which currently depicts a vibrant spiral galaxy with nebulas, stars, and planets. A project grid with a modal view and a contact form UI are also implemented.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: Addressing user feedback about the visuals being pixelated and boxy and navigation not being smooth. The agent's goal was to create a more polished, less boxy UI with smoother navigation and a more immersive 3D world. The agent updated the main React component () and was about to update the corresponding CSS file ().
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool (to check for visual polish and layout) followed by frontend testing agent (to verify animations and interactivity).
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1 (P0)**: Visuals lack polish and smoothness.
- **Issue 2 (P1)**: Contact form is non-functional.
- **Issue 3 (P2)**: Significant performance lag during scrolling.

**Issues Detail**:
- **Issue 1**: Visuals lack polish and smoothness
    - **Description**: The user reported that the design looks pixelated and boxy, and the navigation is not smooth.
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent updated the  file but had not yet applied the corresponding CSS changes.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Create and apply new CSS in  to add  to card elements, refine shadows, and improve spacing to make the UI less boxy.
        2.  Review and optimize the GSAP scroll-triggered animations for smoother transitions.
        3.  Ensure the Three.js renderer is configured with  in  to fix pixelation on high-DPI screens.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To meet the user's core requirement for a premium, high-end visual experience.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
- **Issue 2**: Contact form is non-functional
    - **Description**: The backend API for the contact form () fails with an API key is invalid error, as seen in the backend logs.
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent identified the error but incorrectly dismissed it as expected for a test key without attempting a fix.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Verify the  is correctly set as  in .
        2.  Restart the backend server with backend: stopped
backend: started after checking the  file.
        3.  Review the implementation in  to ensure the Resend SDK is initialized and used correctly with the environment variable.
        4.  Re-examine the integration playbook for Resend to confirm if the  is the correct key to use. The user approved its use, but the API error suggests a problem.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: The contact form is a critical feature for a portfolio website to generate leads.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Backend
- **Issue 3**: Significant performance lag during scrolling
    - **Description**: The user has complained about the website being too much lagging while scrolling and not a seamless experience.
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent has attempted optimizations in the past, but the issue persists. The current implementation uses an extremely high number of particles (15,000+ for the galaxy, 8,000 stars, 2,000 energy particles), which is the likely cause.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Drastically reduce the particle count in the Three.js scene within .
        2.  Optimize particle rendering by using  instead of creating individual objects in a loop.
        3.  Simplify complex materials or shaders if they are contributing to the performance bottleneck.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To provide the smooth, immersive, and premium experience the user has repeatedly requested.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1**: Refine UI and Animation Styling
    - **Where to resume**: The agent needs to generate and write the updated content for  to complement the recent changes in .
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: This will address the user's feedback about boxy UI elements and contribute to a more polished, high-end aesthetic.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**:
- There are no new features requested. The entire focus should be on resolving the pending issues (visual polish, contact form functionality, and performance) to deliver the final, high-quality portfolio.

**Completed work in this session**:
- A single-page React application has been created from scratch.
- A complex, animated 3D galaxy scene using Three.js and GSAP was implemented and iterated upon based on user feedback.
- All content sections requested by the user (Hero, Work, About, etc.) have been added.
- The user's specific project details and social media links have been integrated.
- A backend endpoint for the contact form was created using FastAPI and the Resend library.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**:
- **Issue 1**: The contact form's  integration is broken due to an invalid API key. The agent discovered this from backend logs but did not attempt to fix it, which needs to be the next agent's priority after fixing the UI.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**:
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**:
- **Frontend**: React, Three.js (for 3D rendering), GSAP (for scroll-based animations), CSS.
- **Backend**: FastAPI.
- **Integrations**: Resend (for emails).

**key DB schema**:
- N/A

**changes in tech stack**:
- **Frontend**: Added  and  libraries.
- **Backend**: Added the  library.

**All files of reference**:
- : **Primary file.** Contains the entire 3D scene logic and UI components. It has been overwritten many times.
- : **Primary styling file.** Contains all CSS, including complex animations. Also overwritten multiple times.
- : Contains the contact form API endpoint logic.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **Performance**: The Three.js scene in  is extremely resource-intensive due to a very high particle count. This needs immediate optimization by reducing particles or using more efficient rendering techniques like .
- **Code Structure**: The  component is monolithic, with all 3D logic, UI, and animations in a single large  hook. This should be broken down into smaller, reusable functions or custom hooks for better maintainability.

**key api endpoints**:
- : Endpoint for the contact form. **Currently broken.**

**Critical Info for New Agent**:
- **User is highly design-sensitive.** The top priority is achieving a premium, cinematic, and smooth visual experience. Be prepared for iterative visual feedback.
- **Performance is a critical and recurring issue.** The user has repeatedly mentioned lag. The current implementation with tens of thousands of particles is the likely cause and must be optimized.
- **The contact form is broken.** Do not ignore the invalid API key error. This is a key feature that must be fixed.
- The user's last message was garbled (looking pixel work work is looking real looking box...), but the previous agent interpreted it as a request for more UI polish. You should proceed with this interpretation, focusing on making the UI less boxy and animations smoother.

**documents and test reports created in this job**:
- None. An attempt to run the testing agent was made, but the agent did not wait for the report.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Resend** (Email) — configured to use Emergent LLM Key, but the integration is currently failing with an invalid API key error.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES, but the agent did not wait for the result, and no report was generated.
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
- **Test files created**: []
- **Known regressions**: Scrolling performance and content visibility have been recurring problems that get temporarily fixed and then regress as scene complexity increases.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent failed to complete the fix for the user's latest feedback on UI polish; it updated the JS file but not the CSS file.
- The agent failed to properly debug the non-functional Resend integration, dismissing a critical API key error.
- The agent did not fundamentally solve the performance issues, leading to repeated user complaints about lag.
- The agent did not wait for the output of the testing agent it invoked, missing an opportunity to get a comprehensive bug report.</analysis>
